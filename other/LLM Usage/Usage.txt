This file should have been generated by the 02-data_cleaning.R script.Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue:Steps to Resolve the Issue:1. Check if the cleaning script was run:o Ensure that you have successfully run the 02-data_cleaning.R script. This script should process the raw data and save the cleaned data as cleaned_hate_crimes_data.csv in the outputs/data/ directory.To run the cleaning script in R, use the following:rCopy codesource("02-data_cleaning.R")2. Verify the directory structure:o Ensure that the directory outputs/data/ exists within your project structure. If the directory is missing, create it manually or modify the script to save the cleaned data to an existing path.You can create the directory using this command in R or the terminal:rCopy codedir.create("outputs/data", recursive = TRUE)3. Ensure that the raw data is downloaded:o If you haven’t run the 01-download_data.R script to download the raw data, do that first. This script downloads the raw hate crimes data and saves it in the inputs/data/ directory. If the raw data isn't available, the cleaning script won't work.Run the following:rCopy codesource("01-download_data.R")4. Re-run the 02-data_cleaning.R:o After ensuring the raw data is available, re-run the 02-data_cleaning.R script. This should generate the cleaned data in the correct folder:rCopy codesource("02-data_cleaning.R")5. Check the file path in paper.qmd:o If the cleaned_hate_crimes_data.csv file is being saved to a different location, update the file path in your paper.qmd. Make sure it points to the correct file location where the cleaned data is saved.For example, ensure the file path in your Quarto file matches the actual location:rCopy codecleaned_data <- read_csv(here::here("outputs/data/cleaned_hate_crimes_data.csv"))Summary of Steps:1. Ensure inputs/data/ exists and the raw data is downloaded using 01-download_data.R.2. Ensure outputs/data/ exists for saving the cleaned data.3. Re-run the 02-data_cleaning.R to clean the data and save the cleaned CSV file.4. Re-run the Quarto rendering (quarto render paper.qmd --to pdf) after the cleaned data is available.Once these steps are complete, the cleaned data should exist, and your Quarto document should render successfully. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!Input: source("02-data_cleaning.R") Output: Attaching package: ‘janitor’ The following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’: chisq.test, fisher.test Error: 'inputs/data/raw_data.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('/Users/arshhrelan/Desktop/STA304/Paper 1/scripts'). > ChatGPT said:ChatGPTThe error message indicates that the file inputs/data/raw_data.csv does not exist in the working directory. This suggests that the 01-download_data.R script, which is responsible for downloading and saving the raw data, did not complete successfully.Here’s how to resolve this:1. Ensure the data is downloaded successfully:First, you need to ensure that the raw data file raw_data.csv is downloaded and saved correctly. Since you encountered errors in the download process previously, here’s a step-by-step recap:Step A: Verify the current working directoryBefore running the scripts, ensure you are in the correct working directory where your inputs/data/ folder exists. You can check and set your working directory with:rCopy code# Check your current working directorygetwd()# If needed, set the working directory to the project rootsetwd("/Users/arshhrelan/Desktop/STA304/Paper 1")Step B: Run the 01-download_data.R script to download the dataIf you are in the correct working directory, you can run the download script again to fetch the raw data:rCopy codesource("01-download_data.R")If the script runs successfully, it should save the file in inputs/data/raw_data.csv. Ensure that the inputs/data/folder exists, and if it doesn’t, create it manually:rCopy codedir.create("inputs/data", recursive = TRUE)Step C: Check if the data was savedAfter running the script, you can check if the file was downloaded correctly:rCopy codefile.exists("inputs/data/raw_data.csv")This should return TRUE if the file exists. If the file doesn't exist, it means the download script needs further troubleshooting.2. Re-run the data cleaning scriptOnce the raw data file is downloaded and saved, you can proceed to run the 02-data_cleaning.R script:rCopy codesource("02-data_cleaning.R")This script should clean the raw data and save it as outputs/data/cleaned_hate_crimes_data.csv.Troubleshooting the download issue (if persists):If the download script (01-download_data.R) still does not work, let me know what error you encounter, and I will help you further troubleshoot the issue.After successfully downloading and cleaning the data, you can proceed with rendering your Quarto document. Let me know how it goes!
